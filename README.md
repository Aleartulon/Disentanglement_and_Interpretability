# Repo on Disentanglement and Interpretability.

Main goal is to start by studying the different latent space found by different Reduced Order Modeling techniques and understanding what is a 'disentangled and intepretable latent space'. Once this is done, it would be nice to apply the discoveries to what has been done in https://github.com/Aleartulon/AE_NODE .
