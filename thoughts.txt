- Can two variables be independent but correlated?
- Is it really necessary to use a VAE instead of an AE with an L1 normalization on the latent vectors?
- does enforcing sparsity in the decoder force it to become the 'real function' and thus pushing the real latent dimensions?
- for the latent dimensions, they are uncorrelated only if the full order images are uncorrelated, otherewise they will be as well. So in the latent evolution of the latent space, the latent dimensions of the initial condition fields will be uncorrelated, but once t>0 they will be correlated.
- a latent dimension should be such that if I only change it, I decode the new latent vector and I encode it again, only that latent dimension has changed. Is this connected with encoder and decoder being invertible?
- is the encoder the inverse function of the function that generates high dimensional data from low dimensional factors? The decoder is instead an approximation of the underline generative process.
- The main goal of dimensionality reduction is to find a low dimensional system of coordinate which correctly describes the structure of the high dimensional data. More formally,
data are often represented in high dimensional euclidean spaces, however data (unless random poins) have instrinsically a structure which is represented by a manifold which has an intrinsic dimensionality
lower than the one used by the high dimensional euclidean space.
- there is a difference between the latent structure of an object and the latent structure of the variation of an object: a circle in an image has an instrinsic dimensionality of 3 and it is a nonlinear manifold, 
however if a dataset consists only of one image, then a linear projection would fully represent the image has it is trivially the same vector mulitplied by 1.
- the PCA is different from, for example, an autoencoder (AE), as PCA needs to see variation in data to extract latent dimensions, while AE can extract multiple latent dimensions even from only one sample. So the latent dimensions in PCA are connected
to the variations of the dimensions.
