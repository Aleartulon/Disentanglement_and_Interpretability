# On Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

*These are mostly notes and thoughts and may containt mistakes*

The aim of this document is to (hopefully) present a unified framework for the molteplicity of available methods which appear in the literature under research fields such as *Manifold Learning*, *Dimensionality Reduction* and *Reduced Order Modeling*. We noticed that oftentimes different research fields use the same methodology (under different names) and never talk to each other, making it difficult for researchers to underpin the actual scientific values of the proposed new methods. We also try to go deeper in the connection between *Manifold Learning* and *Dimensionality Reduction*, in order to clarify the main aim of these research fields. Finally, we focus on the application of such ideas to approximating the evolution over time of high dimensional objects subjected to physical constraints (PDEs/ODEs).

## Introduction
Data Science has established itself in the last decade as a challenging and central field of study, attracting thousands of researchers from different disciplines. Arguably, what makes this field so captivating is the dichotomy between the ease of reach of this field (we can all gather some data) and how difficult it can be to make sense of such data. In this sense, Data Science is trying to do what Physics has been doing since the $16\,th$ century: given some observations (data) what can we say about the relationship between them (and first of all, is there even a relationship between them)? While Physics is concerned with natural phenomena, Data Science is concerned with any type of phenomena where observations are available; thus Physics is, at least in this respect, a subset of Data Science.

What is special about Physics is the assumption that observations coming from nature obey some laws that can be expressed in mathematical forms: the goal of Physics is thus writing down such mathematical laws and hoping they are backed out by experiments. In other words, physicists are looking for the *generative process* $\mathcal{G}$ that describes the process of physical phenomena. Intuitively, a generative process $\mathcal{G}$ is an operator that, given a (for simplicity finite) vector of variables $\mathbf{z}$, yields the value of the physical quantity of interest on a given spatio-temporal domain. A few examples:
- a point of a given mass $m$ moving within a uniform gravitational field in a $1D$ space, for a given initial position $x_0$ and a given initial velocity $v_0$. The generative process $\mathcal{G}(x,t|x_0, v_0)$ outputs $1$ if the point is found at position $x$ at time $t$ or zero otherwise;
- the amino acid sequence of a protein $\hat{r}$. The generative process $\mathcal{G}(x,y,z|\hat{r})$ outputs $0$ if no atom is present at $(x,y,z)$ and the atomic speces otherwise;
- the pressure field over the Earth sphere for weather forecasting applications. The generative process $\mathcal{G}(\theta,\phi, t|T,\varphi,\lambda,...)$ outputs the pressure value at the point $(\theta,\phi,t )$ for the initial temperature $T$, the humidity $\varphi$ and the solar radiation $\lambda$ and many other parameters.
